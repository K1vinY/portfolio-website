                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>To improve patients’ tinnitus situation, our team is honored to introduce our project with the ear-EEG to automatically generate suitable masking sound for tinnitus treatment. In the meanwhile, using Artificial Intelligence (AI) method to analysis the type of the tinnitus (pulsatile or non-pulsatile). Our research has highlighted the potential of the measured ear-EEG signal through the earphone and the AI method to identify tinnitus type. This device is promised to be used in daily life, especially for the elder with the high accuracy for detecting tinnitus and giving the patient suitable and direct treatment to overcome the bad impact from tinnitus bring to. This project will contribute with high-quality evidence on the effectiveness of assistive technology in supporting people with tinnitus to help them overcome a discomfort feeling, gain concentration, and have a balanced performance in daily life. Also could avoid the potential risk from pulsatile tinnitus. This study will establish the clinical trial focus groups in Taiwan with 50 participants to use ear-EEG devices and get tinnitus masker treatment. Our product will illustrate improved tinnitus state and the patient’s mood which means that it could reduce patients’ anxiety and stress for homecare. At the same time, we are towards a wearable device with a small size so the patient could bring it along whenever. We do hope it will be an essential assistant for tinnitus patients.</p>

                    <h2>The What</h2>
                    <div class="content-text">
                        <p>Chronic tinnitus affects millions worldwide, significantly reducing quality of life by causing sleep disturbances, anxiety, and concentration difficulties. Existing treatments, such as white noise therapy, offer relief but are not personalized, leading to inconsistent results. Additionally, current methods for evaluating tinnitus rely heavily on subjective feedback, lacking an objective measurement standard. This study aims to develop an IoT-enabled EEG sensing (IEES) headphone that provides customized music (CM) therapy based on the patient's specific tinnitus frequency while also incorporating EEG-based objective assessments to monitor symptom improvement.</p>

                    <h2>The How</h2>
                    <div class="content-text">
                        <p>To address these challenges, the research team developed a wearable IoT-based system that integrates EEG measurement with personalized sound therapy. The IEES headphones were equipped with EEG electrodes to record brain activity and detect changes in neural response to sound therapy. The system used a Pitch Matching (PM) method to tailor music frequencies to individual tinnitus patients, ensuring effective symptom relief. A mobile application was also developed to allow remote monitoring, data collection, and real-time symptom tracking via cloud storage. Clinical trials were conducted over 30 days, where tinnitus patients used the device for 60 minutes daily while EEG data and self-reported tinnitus symptoms were analyzed.</p>

                    <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
                    <div class="results-content">
                        <div class="results-text">
                            <p>The results demonstrated significant reductions in Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and Visual Analog Scale for Annoyance (VAS-A) scores, indicating improved symptom management. EEG analysis showed an increase in alpha band activity, suggesting enhanced relaxation and reduced stress levels. Participants also reported high user satisfaction, with a 4.5/5 acceptance score for daily use. Furthermore, IoT-based real-time monitoring allowed patients and caregivers to track progress remotely, improving accessibility and reducing the need for frequent clinical visits. These findings highlight the potential of IoT-integrated EEG headphones as an innovative and effective tool for tinnitus assessment and management, paving the way for personalized, home-based treatment solutions in audiology and telemedicine.</p>
